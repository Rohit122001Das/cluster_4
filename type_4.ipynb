    "The Silhouette Coefficient is a popular metric for evaluating clustering results, but like any evaluation metric, it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using the Silhouette Coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intuitive Interpretation: The Silhouette Coefficient provides an intuitive interpretation of the quality of clustering. Positive values indicate well-separated clusters, 0 indicates overlapping clusters, and negative values indicate incorrect cluster assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Range and Interpretability: The Silhouette Coefficient has a clear range from -1 to 1, making it easy to understand and compare across different clustering solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cluster Shape Consideration: The Silhouette Coefficient takes into account the distance between points and their cluster centers, which is useful for assessing the shape and compactness of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Agnostic: The Silhouette Coefficient can be applied to various types of data and clustering algorithms without being dependent on the specific distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependency on Distance Metric: The Silhouette Coefficient heavily depends on the choice of distance metric. Different metrics might yield different results, making comparisons across different clustering scenarios challenging.\n",

    "2. Data Scaling Impact: The Silhouette Coefficient can be influenced by the scale of features. It's important to normalize or standardize data before calculating distances to ensure fair comparisons.\n",

    "2. Alternative Distance Metrics:\n",
    "Instead of relying solely on cluster centroids, consider using alternative distance metrics that can capture the shape and distribution of clusters more accurately. Mahalanobis distance or other appropriate metrics can be used.\n",
